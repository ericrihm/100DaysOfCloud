# Serverless Azure Resume API

## Introduction

By developing a serverless API with Azure to showcase my resume I will get familar with utilizing .NET 6 and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Use Case

This project serves as a cloud-based showcase of professional credentials, offering an innovative way to present your resume through a serverless API, accessible and updatable in real-time. 

## Cloud Research

I deepened my understanding of Azure Functions and serverless architecture, gaining hands-on experience in automating deployment using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Coding in .NET 6, I enhanced my technical skills in JSON data representation. A special acknowledgment to [madebygps](https://github.com/madebygps/serverless-resume-api/tree/main) whose resources were instrumental in guiding my learning process.
