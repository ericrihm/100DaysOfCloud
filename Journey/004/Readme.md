# Learning AWS w/ Terraform

## Introduction

I opted to learn AWS and utilize Terraform for resource deployment because of my existing familiarity with Azure, and I wanted to expand my knowledge of Terraform

## Use Case

I wanted to diversify my cloud skills by transitioning from Azure to AWS and adopting Terraform as a versatile IaC tool to efficiently manage and deploy cloud resources, this will allow me to cater to a broader range of cloud-based projects and opportunities.

## Cloud Research
- I started watching Bryan Krausen's Terraform class on Udemy and followed along creating my demo main.tf and variables.tf to deploy
- After installing AWS CLI and setting up an IAM user I had a little trouble setting my credentials while in VSCode. Opening a powershell terminal and using the commands in the documentation allowed me to get started with Terraform
- setx AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
<br>setx AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
<br>setx AWS_DEFAULT_REGION us-west-2

With the enviroment variables set I was able to run my terraform plan to confirm and apply it to start creating my first infrastructe in AWS!
