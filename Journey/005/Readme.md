<br>Today I spun up AzureGoat, an intentionally vulnerable infrastructure that incorporates the latest OWASP Top 10 web application security risks and various misconfigurations in Azure services like App Functions, CosmosDB, Storage Accounts, Automation, and Identities.

It's a sandbox for practicing the mitigation of threats like:

- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- SQL Injection
- Insecure Direct Object References
- Server-Side Request Forgery in App Function Environments
- Sensitive Data Exposure and Password Reset Issues
- Storage Account Misconfigurations
- Identity Misconfigurations

I will be exploring the different modules over the next week and writing my expierence with them. Here's a preview of Module 1

To deploy the infrastructure I used Terraform to create all the neccesary Azure resources. I also passed the Terraform Associate certifcation exam this morning!
